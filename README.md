# Portfolio-Project-3--Biodiversity_Starter
data analysis portfolio

This project had me use csv dataset given alongside filling up NaN values for csv and answering the following questions:
1. What is the distribution of conservation status for animals?
2. Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
3. Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
4. Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?
